Pam is the Marketing Assistant in the SSW Marketing & TV team.

For the better part of the past years, Pam has been devoted to exploring the world — both the outer world and her inner self — which means she enjoys connecting with others and engaging with their unique universes.

Her background in e-commerce live-streaming gave her a solid foundation for social media operations. She has also hosted the Huangshan Maofeng Tea Harvest Ceremony, which further strengthened her ability to presentation.

Pam is also an imaginative creator ✨. She majored in Chinese Language and Literature, which gave her a natural sensitivity to words. During university, she joined the student union’s new media department, where she learned valuable skills in photo editing and video editing. She also enjoys filming and editing travel vlogs and posting them on social media — which gives her a fun way to link her Marketing and TV work.

Pam is passionate about handicrafts 🎨, especially crocheting, and also enjoys reading, traveling, and photography. She loves experiencing new things — recently trying badminton, board games, frisbee, and skateboarding with SSWers. She enjoys exploring the world and unlocking every possibility! 🌍✨
